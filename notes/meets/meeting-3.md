## Meeting Notes - 21st August, 2024

1. **Dynamic Programming + Lexicographical Processing**: Utilize dynamic programming to efficiently generate subsets of size K and process them in lexicographical order.
2. **Data Structure Perspective**: Treat the problem as a data structure challenge, focusing on how to efficiently store and manipulate subsets of size K, rather than solely as an algorithmic problem.

## Action Items

1. Simulate the algorithm to generate subsets of size K in lexicographical order.
2. Compare the performance of the dynamic programming approach with the current implementation.
